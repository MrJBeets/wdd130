    <h2>Jacob Beeton</h2>
    <p> My name is Jacob Beeton I'm currently looking into the Data Science major. If that is my major then I have about a year and a half till I graduate. I love to play games (board/video), watch movies, hiking, and most of all learning. I am engaged currently, I proposed about two weeks ago. Planning for a wedding in December is a bit chaotic. 
    <p></p>Currently I work at Cafe Rio, I've been working there since the end of June early July of this year 2022. Yes my major is going to change my future job. One of the things I love most about BYU-Idaho is the teachers, especially in the religion department. Some of the professors have such a vast knowledge of church/scripture history it's incredible. I'm taking this course because I thought this class would be interesting and benefitial for a potential job in the field of Data Science. I'm hoping that I get a idea of what this field would be like if I persued Data Science.
    <p></p>I was born a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. My favorite quote is from the prophet, he said once in a general conference talk that, women need to be told that their beautiful often. My favorite scripture is James 1:5, and 6 becuase, I love history and Joseph Smith pondered this passage before finding out that none of the churches in the world was the true church of Jesus Christ. </p>
